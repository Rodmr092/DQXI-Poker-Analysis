# Dragon Quest XI Poker Analysis Project

Welcome to the DQXI Poker Analysis project! This project is focused on analyzing the poker game in the popular video game Dragon Quest XI. Specifically, we aim to determine the optimal number of "double or nothing" rounds that players should engage in to maximize their winnings. 

We can develop the project further by analyzing hand strategies, betting sizes, jackpot's mathematical expectation, or other videogame analysis.

## Project Overview

In Dragon Quest XI, the casino offers a unique poker game that seems to be slightly skewed in favor of the player. However, the exact bias and how it affects the game strategy is not well-understood. 
This project seeks to fill that gap by collecting and analyzing data from various game sessions to find the most advantageous strategy for players.

### What We're Doing

- **Data Collection**: We use a Python script to collect data on the outcomes of games, focusing on the "double or nothing" rounds.
- **Analysis**: Analyze the collected data to understand the probabilities of winning at different stages of "double or nothing".
- **Optimization**: Provide recommendations on how many rounds of "double or nothing" a player should engage in.
